# CloudCMS Deployment

## Description

Temporary public repo for deploying our CloudCMS modules.

### Why? 

CloudCMS currently requires modules to be deployed via public repositories. Once they add support for providing an ssh key or github user credentials so they can access a private repo, we can get rid of this deployment repo
